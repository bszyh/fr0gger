# fr0gger

Old project for the OOP course.
Needs fixes, controls can be buggy (ex. for the frog to appear at the start of level the W key neeeds to be pressed repeatedly).
Problems with memory usage and code is pretty messy. 
Added for archive purposes.

## Manual build and install

(assuming that all SFML dependencies are met)
```
$ cd frogger
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
